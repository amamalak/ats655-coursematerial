# ATS 655 - Objective Analysis - Course Material

This gitlab repository stores all of the python examples (.py), data (.csv,.nc), and jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) used in the course. The python examples and their data can just be downloaded and used. For the jupyter notebooks you can:

1. view them directly here in gitlab
2. use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view them by copying the web address for the notebook and replacing "blob" with "raw" as described [here](http://www.tonysaad.net/uncategorized/nbviewer-and-gitlab/)
